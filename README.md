# Minimax
Hi!
This little game uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the next step.
The game is simple. 
You can choose whether the bot takes the first step or you.
One round contains two step.
In the first step you choose a block where you want to go next.
In the second step you choose a block. That block can no longer be used in the game.
Since it's a simple minimax, in the begenning, it can take a little time for the bot to choose from the many options.
